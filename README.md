# Brain Tumor Classification

## Introduction

The Brain Tumor Classification project aims to classify MRI brain images into four categories: meningioma, glioma, pituitary, or no tumor. By utilizing machine learning models, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression, this project provides an automated approach to assist in the accurate classification of brain tumor images.

The implementation is provided as an iPython Notebook (`.ipynb`), leveraging the Sklearn library for building and training the classification models. The models have been trained on a diverse dataset of MRI brain images to ensure reliable and robust performance.

## Key Features

- **MRI Brain Image Classification**: The project focuses on accurately classifying MRI brain images into specific tumor categories, including meningioma, glioma, pituitary, and the absence of a tumor. The trained models utilize advanced machine learning algorithms to make precise predictions.

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: The SVM model, implemented using Sklearn, is used to classify brain tumor images. SVM is known for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and non-linear classification problems effectively.

- **Logistic Regression**: The logistic regression model, also implemented using Sklearn, is another classification algorithm utilized in this project. Logistic regression is well-suited for binary and multi-class classification tasks, providing valuable insights into tumor identification.

- **Model Evaluation**: The project provides comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the SVM and logistic regression models. Test accuracy is reported as a measure of how well the models classify brain tumor images.
